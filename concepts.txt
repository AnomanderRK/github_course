What is Git?
    - Distributed source control system
    - Massively sclaes
    - open source
    - Developed for linux project requirements
    - most operations are local
    - very fast
    - active community
    - Most popular DVCS, VCS

 Repository contains the history of changes, files, config managed by Git

 States of git
    Working directory - git repository contains the actual git code
    Staging area - pre-commit holding area
    commit - Git repository (History)

 remote repository - last stage (Github)
 Master branch

 untrack file - file that is not being added to github yet- is in the working directory

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install Git
    a.- windows
        git-scm.com installer
    b.- mac
        git version
        git-scm.com (git for mac installer)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

using git bash
commands:
    git version
    git clone [url]             copy the repository to the local machine
    git status                  tells the status of the local branch and working directory status
    git add [file]              pass the untracked file to the staging area
    git commit -m "comments"                  commit the new file(s) from the staging area into the local git repository
    git push origin master      push the files added to the local repository to the branch we want (master this case)

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    git init [name project]     Start a new project
    git init                    initialize a new git repository in the current directory
    git add .                   add all the modified files to the git staging area (can add folders)

    we can use fork in github to copy a git project into our repository


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    git pull origin master      update the local repository with all the changes from the master
    git push origin master      update the master branch with the changes. Do this after git pull - best practice
    git commit -am "commit text"    add the changes to the staging area and commit te file in the same line-
                                    only files being tracked
    git ls-files                list of tracked files
    git reset HEAD <file>       Unstage a file from the stage area
    git checkout -- <file>      Discard changes in working directory and returns the file to the last commited state
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    git mv file_name.ext new_file_name.ext  Rename or move  a file (keep track of the file, no matter the name
    git add -A                  if we move or rename a file, using other that git command, we can still keep track of it
    fit rm file_name.ext        remove a tracked file
        git commit -m "deleting new file"   need to commit to save the changes

    git help log                # help from git
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    History
    git log                     # shows all the commits
    git log --follow -- path.file.to.follow         show all the commits related to file
    git show <id>                                   #show the details of the commited id

                custom commands
    git config --global alias.hist "log --all --graph --decorate --oneline"
                                    # creates a custom command with name list with the instruction in quotes
                 # use the new command ---- git hist
                 # config is the file where we saved the alias
                 # modify this config file ----  editor ~/.gitconfig

    .gitignore      # we can create a file named ,gitignore to list all the excluded files that we don't want to track
             in file .gitignore we can use some patterns like
                *.log       - exclude all the files with extension .log
                directory/  - exclude the directory and its content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    git diff        # list the differences between a file that is in the working directory and the same file in the
                    # staging area. Suppose we were modifying some file
    git difftool    # graphic interface that shows the differences of the file in the working directory and the one
                    # in the staging area
    git diff HEAD   # shows the differences between the working directory and the last commit in the current branch
    git difftool HEAD
    git diff id_commit1 id_commit2  # compare two commits

        WE CAN USE PYCHARM TO COMPARE FILES
